# Jets

Jets is a lightweight, extensible forward-mode automatic differentiation framework with pluggable numerical backends. 
It provides a clean core abstraction for dual-number–style differentiation while allowing backend-specific array implementations (e.g. NumPy).

## Features

- Forward-mode automatic differentiation
- Backend-agnostic core with a simple registration system
- NumPy backend included
- Pytorch backend included

## Status

This project is minimal by design and intended as a foundation for experimentation, research, or extension—not a full replacement for mature AD frameworks.
